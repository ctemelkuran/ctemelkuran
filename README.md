<h2 align="center">👋 Hey, I'm Çığır (you can say it like "Cheer")</h2>

I’m a software engineer based in Frankfurt, Germany.  
Most of my work is with **Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and TypeScript**.  
I’ve also worked with **Kotlin + Quarkus** for microservices, and used **AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, and Bash** when the job needs it.

I focus on building software that’s **useful and reliable**, and I try to keep things simple.
